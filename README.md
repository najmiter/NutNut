# NutNut - a streaming website (that doesn't actually stream)

This was our 5th semester final project (dotnet and blazor pages). It does all the warm stuff like:
- Sign in
- Sign out
- Sign up
- Sign up for premium (yeah they're differently implemented)
- Check for valididty of the premium membership (it's a monthly subscription)
- Show movies/tv shows from a local database (**MSSQL**) managed by **C#**
- Show the watch page to only a premium member (free users are redirected to sign up for a premium page)

There may be other features too. Don't really remember anymore.
